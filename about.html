									<h3>A lots changed since I graduated from the University of Washington!</h3>
									<p>During my Senior year at UW, I worked hard to identify what I wanted to do post college. I was on track to obtain my Bachelor of Science degree in Informatics, focusing on Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, and I knew I wanted to work in a field related to that focus, but wasn’t sure where to start. Through my previous internship experience, the recruiting process, and various informational sessions, I soon realized I was attracted to consulting. I landed a perfect role as a Consultant with West Monroe Partners in the Fall and was ready to start that following year. Being a consultant really spoke to me as I was unsure at the time what I wanted to dive into professionally, but I was confident that technology and specifically the Cloud were huge interests of mine. Fast forward 3+ years, and I am still with West Monroe to this date! It has been an amazing experience growing my knowledge and skillset in the Cloud Infrastructure space and I am excited to see where this path takes me in the future.</p>
									<p>So much more than just professional change has happened in that same 3+ years. I have moved 5 different times, with the last move being to Los Angeles! I got married, invested in the stock market (you know, adult stuff), grew my passions and hobbies and the list goes on. Life really does seem to change so much in such a short time, and I don’t plan on slowing down one bit!</p>

							<p>As I journey down this continued season of change and growing, I aim to push myself to learn more, stay curious, and to always remember to enjoy the little things. There is so much more I could say, but I’m sure if you still reading this about page, you really must not know anything about me, so feel free to reach me on any socials listed below if you’re still curious about who I am!</p>
