##### 1. What information does your visualization show? What 'argument' are you making? #####
> My visualization shows the outcome of the altercations with the police force. You can see how many ended in the victims being killed, hit, and also unknown. You can also see a statistic about how many of the victims were armed, vs unarmed or unknown. 

##### 2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> No I did not

##### 3. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> Rutvi Patel

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> 20 hours.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> It was very difficult understanding exatcly how to use the leaflet thing. Hmm, I would say that a little more direction in exactly how to target the homework would be nice. Other than that, it was just a hard assignment that took me a long time.
